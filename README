DISCLAIMER

This is not production software in any sense of the word.  I am making
it available as a companion to my paper, with the primary purpose of
allowing someone else to see, in full gory detail, how that was
implemented.  Any software release niceties you may find in this
package, like documentation, are purely accidental.

INFORMATION

To execute the test suite, get an MIT Scheme and load the file
all-tests.scm.

If you happen to have rake installed, running rake will do that.

The most interesting non-test code is in distribution.scm and
implicit.scm, but other files loaded by load-probscheme.scm might be
fun to read, too.

There are a fair number of tests of various degrees of interest in the
examples/ directory, and in general tests are in files matching
*-test.scm.

The test suite is coded in a hand-rolled unit test framework, enclosed
in the testing/ directory.  That is documented in pod format in the
file testing/load.scm.

The most elaborate example is a program to play the game 'hangman', in
examples/hangman.scm.  It may have some working directory dependence,
in order to find its data files.
