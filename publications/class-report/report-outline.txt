How much motivation do we want?

What _is_ probabilistic computation?
- We chose the creation, manipulation, and querying of probability
  distributions
- Differentiate from more general processing of beliefs in 
  (possibly non-constructive) propositions?

Specification of distributions
- make-discrete-distribution
- explicit combinators
- implicit language
  - mention Monte Carlo as a natural way to think about the meaning
    of stochastic thunks

Querying distributions

Implementation
- core idea of density streams
- distribution objects as caches
  - caches are needed to answer questions efficiently
- mechanism for converting stochastic thunks to density streams
- density-stream->mass-stream (we need it for distribution-select)

Results?
- hangman.scm plays a mean game of hangman
  - Contrast with various straw men?
  - Do we want to talk about how fast it is?

Future Work
- numerical issues
- dependency discovery and exploitation
- continuous distributions
  - reasoning by proofs rather than direct computations?
- user supplied hints for inference
  - A* heuristics
  - explicit dependencies
